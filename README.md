# Bazel Codelab

## Before you get started
Take a look at these [informational slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CpgAwaPEjJI-q-29FhGBQk0M7iZDxbPAJYjI8s57KmA/edit#slide=id.p) to learn about Bazel.

## Codelab instructions
1. Click on `Code` -> `Create codespace on main` to launch a new codespace.
1. Wait for the codespace to finish setting up. This should be quick in regions with prebuilt codespaces. 
1. Once you get a shell prompt in your codespace, run `./next_exercise.sh` to move to `exercise-000-intro`.

```bash
./next_exercise.sh
```

### Note
`./next_exercise.sh` is destructive. If you would like to save any work, clone locally and commit before running any scripts.
